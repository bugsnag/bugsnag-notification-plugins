Bugsnag Notification Plugins
============================

Bugsnag.com can notify you when errors happen in your applications.
We've created a plugin architecture so you can contribute notification
plugins for services you use.

[Bugsnag](http://bugsnag.com) captures errors in real-time from your web,
mobile and desktop applications, helping you to understand and resolve them
as fast as possible. [Create a free account](http://bugsnag.com) to start
capturing exceptions from your applications.

Project Status ![maintenance only](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-maintenance%20only-orange.svg)
--------------

Bugsnag is in the process of moving to a more integrated approach to
notification plugins, moving the development internally to reduce logic
duplication between third-party plugins and application behavior. The existing
plugins will continue to operate, however they will be superceded by better
counterparts in the near future.

Reporting Bugs or Feature Requests

Please report any bugs or feature requests for notification plugins to

Plugin Creation Guide
---------------------

### Writing your plugin

Notification plugins should be written in JavaScript or CoffeeScript and are
executed in a queue using our internal node.js application.

Plugins should extend the base `NotificationPlugin` class defined in
`notification-plugin.js` and override the `receiveEvent` function to perform
the notification. This method is fired when a new event is triggered.

It is easiest to write plugins using CoffeeScript, for example:

```coffeescript
NotificationPlugin = require "../../notification-plugin.js"
class MyPlugin extends NotificationPlugin
  @receiveEvent = (config, event) ->
    # Do the hard work here

module.exports = MyPlugin
```

If you prefer to write your plugin with plain old JavaScript, this is also
possible:

```javascript
var util = require("util");
var NotificationPlugin = require("../../notification-plugin.js")

function MyPlugin() {}
util.inherits(MyPlugin, NotificationPlugin);
MyPlugin.receiveEvent = function (config, event) {
  // Do the hard work here
};

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```


### Testing your plugin

By extending the `NotificationPlugin` class, you'll be able to test your
plugin directly on the command line. In your new plugin directory
(`plugins/your-plugin`) run `index.coffee` directly:

    > coffee index.coffee --option=value --anotherOption=something

Command line options represent the customizable per-project settings as
defined in your `config.json` file.

> Note: You should ensure you have run `npm install` in the top level
directory first, to install the dependencies for the project.


### Event Format

As well as passing the user's plugin configuration settings, we also pass you
an event object, which tells you the reason we triggered a notification.

```javascript
event: {

    // Contains information about the account which has had an event
    account: {
        // The account name
        name: "Account Name",

        // The url for the Bugsnag dashboard of the account
        url: "https://bugsnag.com/dashboard/"
    },

    // Contains information about the project which has had an event
    project: {
        // The project name
        name: "Project Name",

        // The url for the Bugsnag dashboard of the project
        url: "https://bugsnag.com/dashboard/project-name"
    },

    // The reason the user is being notified by the notifier
    trigger: {
        // The identifier for the reason for notification
        type: "firstException",

        // The human readable form of the trigger. This can be used to start
        // a sentence.
        message: "New exception"
    },

    // The error that caused the notification (optional). Will not be present if
    // the project has hit the rate limit.
    error: {
        // The class of exception that caused the error
        exceptionClass: "NullPointerException",

        // The message that came with the exception. This may not be present if
        // the exception didn't generate one.
        message: "Null cannot be dereferenced",

        // The context that was active in the application when the error
        // occurred. This could be which screen
        // the user was using at the time, for example.
        context: "BugsnagMainActivity",

        // The application version
        appVersion: "1.2.3",

        // The release stage, will most often be production, or development.
        releaseStage: "production",

        // The number of times this exception has occurred (including this one)
        occurrences: 1,

        // When was the error first received. Will be a Date object.
        firstReceived: new Date(),

        // How many users have been affected. Could be 0 if there was no user
        // associated with the error.
        usersAffected: 1,

        // The URL on bugsnag.com with the full details about this error
        url: "https://bugsnag.com/errors/example",

        // The stack trace for this error. An array of stack frames.
        stacktrace: [{
            // The file that this stack frame was in.
            file: "BugsnagMainActivity.java",

            // The line number of the stack frame, within the file.
            lineNumber: 123,

            // The method that was being executed.
            method: "onCreate",

            // Indicates that this stack fram was within the project. If the key
            //is not present, it is assumed to be false.
            inProject: true
        }
        ...
        ]
    }
}
```

### HTTP request helper

Since most notification plugins will use http for communication to external
services, we've provided a `request` helper function. This function provides
a `superagent` request object, which you can
[read about here](http://visionmedia.github.com/superagent/). Some examples:

```coffeescript
// Perform a HTTP GET request
@request
  .get("http://someurl.com")
  .send(params)
  .end()


// Perform a normal HTTP POST request
@request
  .post("http://someurl.com")
  .send(params)
  .type("form")
  .end()


// Perform a HTTP POST request with a JSON body
@request
  .post("http://someurl.com")
  .send(params)
  .end()
```


### config.json format

Your plugin's `config.json` file describes to users how to use and configure
your plugin from their Bugsnag dashboard. The file must be a valid JSON file
and look similar to the following example:

```javascript
{
    // The name of the plugin.
    "name": "HipChat",

    // A description of the action that will be performed.
    "actions": {
      "create": "Post to a HipChat chatroom",
    },

    // We trigger notifications when certain events occur in bugsnag (see the
    // Event Format documentation above). To signal which triggers your plugin
    // understands, set this to an array of trigger strings.
    // eg. ["exception", "firstException"].
    "supportedTriggers": ["firstException"],

    // The type of plugin ("issueTracker", "communication", or "other")
    "type": "communication",

    // An array of fields to present to the user on the Bugsnag.com dashboard.
    "fields": [{
        // The name of the field. This is how you will reference the field in
        // the configuration options that are passed to your notifier when it is
        // run. Should be camelCase.
        "name": "authToken",

        // The label to display to the user for this field
        "label": "Auth Token",

        // A full description or hint for this field.
        "description": "Your HipChat API auth token",

        // The data type of this field, either string, select, password or boolean
        // (optional, defaults to string)
        "type": "boolean",

        // An array of selectable values to present in the dropdown list
        // (required when type == "select").
        "allowedValues": ["yellow", "red", "green", "purple", "random"],

        // A default value for this field (optional).
        "defaultValue": "yellow"

        // A link to documentation for this field - or a method of obtaining the value (optional)
        // Can also contain other fields by using {fieldName} in the URL. In the following example
        // applicationKey is another configuration option that is required for this URL.
        "link": "https://trello.com/1/authorize?key={applicationKey}&name=Bugsnag"
    }
    ...
    ]
}
```
